## Vector Inner Product

### Geometric Intuition

Inner product is defined as $<u,v>=||u||||v||cos (\theta)$.
- Large positive: vectors point in similar directions
- Zero: vectors are orthogonal
- Negative: vectors point in opposite directions

### Projection

#### Vector 

$$\text{proj}_u(v)=\frac{v\cdot u}{u\cdot u}u$$
- $v\cdot u$ measures how aligned vectors are
- dividing by denominator normalises for length of u
- multiplying by u gives a vector in u's direction

Basically, take a vector u and finds the parts of it that point in the direction of the other vector v. 

### Linear Transformations

Some combination of scale, rotate shift. Basically origin stays at origin, parallel lines remain parallel. Must satisfy both of the following conditions $$T(x+y)=T(x)+T(y)$$ $$T(\alpha x)=\alpha T(x)$$
