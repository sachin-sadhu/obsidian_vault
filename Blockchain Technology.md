Chain of blocks, where each block will contain a hash value, the actual data, and also the has of a previous block. When the data of a block is changed, this causes the hash to also change. This therefore allows security as if 1 person changes their hash, the next block that points to it will detect an error as the hash it points to does not match.

For cypto, each block is made up of a number of transactions, such as Person A paying Person B 20 coins, along with a proof of work value. This proof of work value is a number that is added to all the other transactions in that block, and when put in some cryptographic hash function, it satisfies a certain condition.
## Smart contracts
Just like an actual contract, except it is a program that is stored using blockchain technology. This means it is distributed and P2P verified.
