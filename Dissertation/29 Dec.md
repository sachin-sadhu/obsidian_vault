## Keys

12 major, 12 minor keys

For major keys, we can build a triad starting from each of the 7 notes in that octave.  

Pattern is major, minor, minor, major, major, minor diminished.

### 7th chord

Can also get 7th note to each triad, where 7th note we add is 7 intervals up from base note. 
Only base note of key gets this

## Slash chords

Might just treat slash chords as the same as their normal chords. then see how it sounds

## Ideas for training chords

Keep chords relative to that key, allows maximum of dataset to be used for training. When generating, then map chords progression to key specifics. 

Other idea is to have seperate transition matrix for each key, however, means each key has very little training data. 

## Diatonic Chords

Diatonic chords are chords that belong to the key. For example, in C Major, there are no accidentals, therefore, a chord that begins on something like C# is borrowed and is called non-diatonic.
