## Octal
Why was octal created? Created because writing denary values in binary requires alot of digits. 18,296 in base 10 is : 101,000,000,110,101 in binary
By combining 3 triplets of binary values we get these values :

000 represents 0 	100 represents 4
001 represents 1 	101 represents 5
010 represents 2 	110 represents 6
011 represents 3 	111 represents 7

Hence value 101,000,000,110,0101 becomes 50065 in base 8 (octal)
