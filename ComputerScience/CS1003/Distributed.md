## Distributing data

Characteristics of Distributed Systems
A collection of distinct computers that appear to its users as one computer
Computers all operate concurrently
Compuers fail independantly

Advantages
	Improves Scalability
	Improves Performace
	Improves Resilience

Disadvantages
	Harder to write software 
	More area for errors to occur
	Harder to understand the system


## Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling
	
Vertical Scaling
	Buying a bigger machine, more powerful processor, more of them
	Limited scope for expansion
	Expensive
	Existing sofrware will probably still work

Horizontal Scaling (Distributing Data)
	Becomes inevitable for larger systems
	Buying more of same machine (usually)
	Introduces software complexity
	Potential inconsistency
	Introduces communication overheads
